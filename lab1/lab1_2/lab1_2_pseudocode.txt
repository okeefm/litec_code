This code is designed to play a game with the participant: Light 2 LEDs, and make them hit the correct pushbuttons for those LEDs. */

All necessary chip initialization

Declare necssary sbits

main function
	initialize the ports
	
	infinite loop
		if the switch is set to on, start a new game
			
			for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
				get a random number between 0 and 2
				if it's 0, light LED0
				if it's 1, light LED1
				if it's 2, light both
				
				listen for 1 second for button presses
					if the button presses are correct, light the green BILED
					if they're incorrect, light the red one
				if there's no button presses, light the red BILED
				
				record the score (correct/incorrect)
				
			output the score to the serial interface
